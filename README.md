# AI Analytics Agent

An AI-powered analytics system that enables natural language exploration of structured business data using an ETL-based data pipeline, semantic analytics API, and LLM-driven insights generation.

---

## Business Context

Modern analytics systems often suffer from fragmented data sources, inconsistent metrics definitions, and high dependency on engineering teams for insights generation.

This project simulates an airline retail analytics environment and demonstrates how an AI layer can simplify data exploration and reporting.

---

## Features

- ETL pipeline for structured data preparation
- Layered data architecture (raw → processed → marts)
- Analytics API for metric computation
- LLM-based natural language interface
- Automated insight generation and reporting

---

## Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

- **Data Layer**: raw transactional datasets (CSV → parquet)
- **Processing Layer**: ETL transformations and data modeling
- **Serving Layer**: Analytics API exposing business metrics
- **AI Layer**: LLM-based agent for query interpretation and reasoning

## Data Handling


### Data Processing Flow

Raw transactional data is transformed through an ETL pipeline:

| #  | Step                                     | Project structure | ETL step      |
|----|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1  | Data ingestion (CSV → raw layer)         | `data/raw`        | E (extract)   |
| 2  | Data cleaning, validation, anonymization | `data/processed`  | T (transform) |
| 3  | Data modeling into analytical marts      | `data/marts`      | L (load)      |

Output: data in a star schema in columnar format (Parquet) stored in `data/marts`

---

### Data Sources

The system is based on synthetic airline retail operations data:

- Flight sales transactions (products sold per flight)
- Passenger occupancy data
- Payment transactions (card/cash simulation)
- Inventory / stock levels per flight
- Flight schedule and route data

---

### Data Processing
As an intermediate step, raw data is transformed into a processed layer stored in Parquet format.

This layer includes:
- cleaned and standardized column names
- normalized data types (dates, numeric fields)
- deterministic anonymization of sensitive fields
- validation and basic quality checks

The processed layer preserves the original granularity of the data while ensuring consistency and usability for downstream analytics.

Flight data example:

```
  flight_no scheduled_date scheduled_time    origin destination class  pax
0     AB133     2026-01-01          22:40  city_001    city_002     Y  174
1     AB134     2026-01-02          05:00  city_002    city_001     Y  166
2     AB714     2026-01-01          09:00  city_001    city_003     Y  125
3     AB715     2026-01-01          13:30  city_003    city_001     Y  174
4     AB141     2026-01-01          22:40  city_001    city_004     Y  174
```

All datasets are anonymized using deterministic mappings.
Sensitive mappings (e.g. city codes) are externalized and excluded from version control.
To see an example of mapping file, `data/config/mapping_example.json` can be used.

### Data Model

The final analytical layer (data marts) will follow a star schema design, consisting of fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries and LLM-driven exploration.
